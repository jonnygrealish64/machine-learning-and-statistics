# machine-learning-and-statistics
Machine Learning and Statistics @ GMIT 2021

Assessment (100%)

GitHub Repository (20%):
The repository should contain the following:
10%: A clear and informative README.md, explaining why the repository exists, whatâ€™s in it, and how to run the notebooks.
10%: A requirements.txt file that enables someone to quickly run your notebooks with minimal configuration. You should also include any other required files such as data files and image files.

Scikit-Learn Jupyter Notebook (40%):
Include a Jupyter notebook called scikit-learn.ipynb that contains the following.
10%: A clear and concise overview of the scikit-learn Python library.
20%: Demonstrations of three interesting scikit-learn algorithms: Decision Trees, Clustering/Biclustering, Manifold learning.
10%: Appropriate plots and other visualisations to enhance your notebook for viewers.

Scipy Stats Jupyter Notebook (40%):
Include a Jupyter notebook called scipy-stats.ipynb that contains the following:
10%: A clear and concise overview of the scipy.stats Python library.
20%: An example hypothesis test using ANOVA. You should find a data set on which it is appropriate to use ANOVA, ensure the assumptions underlying ANOVA are met, and then perform and display the results of your ANOVA using scipy.stats.
10%: Appropriate plots and other visualisations to enhance your notebook for viewers.

Due: last commit on or before December 19th, 2021
